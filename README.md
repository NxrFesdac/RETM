# Recurrent Embdedded Topic Model

This library provides all the tools necesary to run the Recurrent Embedded Topic Model (RETM).

The RETM is a modification of the Embedded Topic Model which uses Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM) to help calculate the topic-document distribution improving drastically the perplexity calculated in traning data sets. The code from the ETM comes from https://github.com/adjidieng/ETM and an adaptation made by Luis Matos https://github.com/lffloyd/embedded-topic-model. The original paper for the RETM can be found at:

In order to use the model, please see how main.py uses the model and adjust it to your own dataset.
